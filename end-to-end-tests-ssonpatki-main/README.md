# CS 362: End-to-End Tests

In this assignment, you will use Playwright to write end-to-end tests for a Roman numeral calculator application.

To launch the application (which is required for testing it), run:

```shell
npm install
npm run serve
```

Styling is done with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) instead of vanilla CSS.

For this assignment, youâ€™ll need to install and set up [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Here's a quick overview of the tests to implement:

- simple calculation conversion
- calculation and conversion to "modern" roman
- user registration
- user login
- calculation history
- logout

You can find demonstration videos of the different features in the `./videos` directory.

Read the assignment details and rubrics on Canvas before you start. Don't forget to push your repository back to GitHub Classroom once you are done.

Submit your GitHub Classroom repository link to Canvas.
