# CS 362: Integration Tests

For this assignment, you will need to:

1. write UI-based integration tests for a user registration form
2. write UI-based integration tests for a roman numeral converter application

If you want to run the applications to test them out, first run:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install the `http-server` package.

Then run either of these:

```shell
npm run serve:registerUser
```

```shell
npm run serve:numerals
```

You can find demonstration videos of both apps in their respective directories: `/registerUser` and `/romanNumerals`.

Styling is done with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) instead of vanilla CSS.

Vitest is already included in the dependencies, but you'll need additional tools and libraries:

- The [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) library for creating a virtual DOM environment. You need to setup the [vitest jsdom environment](https://vitest.dev/guide/environment.html#jsdom).
- The [@testing-library/dom library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library) for locating UI elements as a user would.
- The [@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) library for extending Vitestâ€™s expect function with DOM-specific matchers.
- The [@testing-library/user-event](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) library for simulating user interactions with the apps.
- The [Mock Service Worker API](https://mswjs.io/) for mocking responses from web API data requests.
